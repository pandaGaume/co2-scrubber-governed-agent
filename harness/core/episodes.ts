/**
 * Episodes (2026-09-29, the memory audit): what a task's trace says of its submissions, as one semantic unit a model and the
 * reflection can read, instead of a signal to be found again in a long trace. Made by a pure function of the manifest's
 * steps: the manifest stays the ground truth, an episode is its structured reading, the working memory a window of them.
 *
 *   episode      one task's attempts at the capabilities its topic's guard judges (`judges`): the first is the action, the
 *                others its retries, each with the arguments that matter (the topic's digest), its outcome and who
 *                decided it (the guard, the harness before it, the output limit, the capability itself), and the
 *                episode's final outcome;
 *   contrast     a field a rejected attempt was refused on, with what the attempt sent there and what the next accepted
 *                attempt sent there: X refused, Y accepted, read from the trace, never written by hand.
 *
 * No application, no topic in here: the fields are paths, the arguments whatever the topic's digest gives.

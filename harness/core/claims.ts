/**
 * The claims registry of a task (2026-10-10, docs/registre-des-affirmations.fr.md): every proposition the task holds about the world,
 * a number or a sentence, with where it comes from, its epistemic status and the history of its status.
 *
 *   OBSERVED      present in a source read: a tool's answer, the description, a measurement
 *   VERIFIED      confirmed by a source with authority: a fact of a signed document, or a measurement; set by code, never by a model
 *   INFERRED      produced by a model with no source that confirms it
 *   AMBIGUOUS     more than one reading
 *   CONTRADICTED  contradicted by a VERIFIED claim, or by a reviewer naming the fact that contradicts it
 *   UNKNOWN       not determined, said as such
 *
 * Two rules hold it together: an inference never becomes a fact because it is repeated (only code, on a source with authority, makes a
 * claim VERIFIED); a contradicted claim stays in the registry with its history and never goes back into a prompt (`current`).
 *
 * The registry is the task's, kept in its progress and written to its workshop at the end (`claims.json`). It holds only what the task
 * introduced or used, never a copy of the library.

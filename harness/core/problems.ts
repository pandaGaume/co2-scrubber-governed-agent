 * A refusal, as the next prompt says it, whatever refused (2026-09-28): the
 * reinjection had been written refusal kind by refusal kind (a constant with
 * no justification, a name that is no constant), and a kind it did not know
 * (a safety constant justified by a fact of another unit) looped nineteen
 * times with the same text. Here every refusal becomes problems, each with
 * the path it is about, what is expected there and what was sent, when the
 * guard knows them; a refusal that is only text is read into problems the
 * same way (a schema's `data/<path> must ...`, a guard's `<kind>: <path> ...`).
 * The runner keeps the streak of refusals on the same points, whatever the
 * input sent: the second says what is expected at each point and nothing
 * else, the third ends the task, naming them (`STUCK_AFTER`).
